		<p>Hi! My name is Emma, and I am currently a junior at <a href = "http://www.si.umichedu"> 	University of Michigan School of Information</a> studying Information Analysis. This major focuses on providing me with the skills and knowledge to identify and ask the important questions, gather relevant information and data, come up with solutions, and then present those solutions effectively. Through this major, I have been able to develop and blend both hard, technical skills and soft, interpersonal skills. I am really looking forward to the next year and a half in the School of Information.

		<p> I am from a suburb of Chicago, called Highland Park, which is about 35 minutes north of the city. I went to Highland Park High School and have lived in the same house for my whole life! Leaving home to go to school for the first time was quite an adjustment, but not I'm used to it.
